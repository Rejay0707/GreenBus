Back-End

•
I did the backend development efforts for 'Green Bus,' where I built a resilient online bus ticketing platform.
•
Employing Node.js and Express.js, I architected a scalable server and integrated essential functionalities such as user authentication, bus management, trip scheduling, and ticket reservation, all efficiently stored in MongoDB.
•
I meticulously crafted RESTful APIs for user authentication, bus and trip management, and ticket booking, which are neatly organized in a GitHub Postman collection, demonstrating my adeptness in backend development.
